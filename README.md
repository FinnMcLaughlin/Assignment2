The game features 2 levels, each featuring multiple waves of enemies, and a final boss level, where the player goes up against 'The Eye'

##Level 1
Level 1 has the player face against Hive enemies. These enemies attempt to use brute force to diminish the player's health. The Hive use 2 different movement patterns in this level, a straight down approach, and a zig zag approach.

##Level 2
Level 2 introduces a new enemy, Patriots. Although these enemies have less health than Hive enemies, Patriots shoot back at the player from above. A new pattern is introduced as well, where the enemies come in from the side of the screen and then proceed to move down once they reach a certain distance from the centre of the screen. This level gives more of a claustraphobic feel as both Hive and Patriot spawn together, one firing andd one preventing the players evasion from the bullets

##Final Level
The final level does not include either the Hive or the Patriot enemy. Instead the final level features the introduction of 'The Eye', a boss enemy who moves from side to side, firing a laser every 3/4 seconds. The Eye's health is significantly more than the previous enemies, with it's health bar appearing above it. As well as the boss enemy, a new enemy is introduced, the Guard. The Guard enemy appears in groups of 4, and moves from one side of the screen to the other, in an attempt to block the player's bullets and protect 'The Eye'. These enemies have significantly less health than the enemies from previous levels, yet their strength in numbers proves a challenge when attempting to defeat 'The Eye'
